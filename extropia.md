### before

came in basic pod

Jhovians really hate this

### during

Barrows gives testomony

### after

weak bio non-morphs had to go to sleep

tracked PC to overnight resting place

odd looking ports + panels on outside of cavern/facade

ghosts changed apearance


Jhovians went south

## the Doc and F.R.I.D.A show

static barier around crime scene

got in with l337 medical skills and walking DDG bot, got access USB stick

is bad, lots of lost limbs (no problem though as surely they have insurence), blood everywhere, "painted, but with BLUUUUD"

got acosted by "normal dudes" who wanted to get onto the jovians ship and cause shit

healed some dudes, wasn't able to heal some dudes

dudes think Doc is ganger due to tats


plan: doc plays along, with Aspect

goal: keep tabs on them, feed to LLA to feed to PC, helps smooth over tentions, shows that that wasnt the plan?

FRIDA and Pops spy on Jhovians

## Aspect @ rep research

confirms what Giest said

knows a virologist, gives reference

able to find fabber and get spy drone 

morbs printers... "its morbin time"

## bts and Geist go full corpo

got into LC hotel

persuaded them to meet, info broker + corpo

ghosts and one delegate on board with talking with LLC, other 3 want to murder LLC and start war

ghosts think we should work directly with them

got to meet with delegates

-- cliffhanger --


Hanaman - LLC diplomat

concrete-realiable info on why Hanamen brought lost gen on board


### the three plans

## bts and Geist placate the PC

lost came recomended by someone

knew that Cross was a futura, but beleived that futura was a myth, didnt know could go pyscho

wanted to meet with Jhovians seperatly but PC insisted on being present

Hanaman worried about someone hiring a hacker or someone like Direct Action - errasing ego

Cross was sent to recon the Jhovians when incident happend

Barrows/Hanaman knows Geist is Geist

Hanaman gave Geist backup co-ords (fuckin idiot)

## FRIDA and Aspect go along with the militia

pinged local network to find location of LLC sent to bts/Geist



## Pops and FRIDA spy on the Jhovians

pops almost gets caught

pops learns about the static wall, interfearence caused by bouncing signals between communications towers

got caught a bunch

went to V zone



## Apect and Doc join the hit-squad

Doc watches some gangsta documentorys to learn how to be gangsta

## bts and Geist give info on hit squad to LLA to give to PC

Hanaman initates a self deletion protocol

sent back to PC, they were pissed, but believed our story

Gave Hanaman's backup location to the PC to show that he had no intention of derailing the talks with the Jhovians

get contact info from Galetia - gain 10 C-rep Hellena Freez CEO Gamax

## Pops and FRIDA warn the Jhovians

get though V-sector

make contact with Jhovians

Copperman - one of the PC?

manage to convince Jhovians by telling them about the plan of the insurgents

escaped by hacking turrets

## Aspect and Doc ready to go

meet with hit-squad

yee-har'd out into V space
