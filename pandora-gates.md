## left mercury for the volcanoids

got to know the partay

got kicked off the ship + it left

met with a neotenic

sent several drones into the gate, but nothing has come back

there's a bunch of equipment for us to look at, but not take, they will find out if we take it

there are other gatecrashers there and other gates, group of 3 that Gramps seems to know

we get individual rooms

partitioned equipment room 

- 6 x enviro suits - contact <number> for refits
- 6 x small pack of medical supplies
- 6 x machine pistol, battle rifle + 3 mags for each
- 2 x exploration drone "explorornaut"
- 6 x requisition form for extra equipment not listed
- 1 x dragonfly drone "for F.R.I.D.A"

## the calm before the storm

met with sweedish chef, ordered food/drink that hasn't existed since the fall, but he got it

Gramps gets all rattatue eyes

Silja gets sassy with Gramps, tries to set up date with grannies

Silja has an existential crisis over not knowing if dead and getting backed up

Silja gets fangirled 

Giest gets suddenly the need to isolate herself, Silja suddenly gets the need to talk to her fans, surely there is no connection between the two

Grams does not like 

Gave Gramps the rundown on extropia, he is notisably concerned

## frida and the dragonfly

neotenic told frida he can sleave into the dragonfly early to get aclamated to it

dragonfly is outfit to special materials, makes it more durable

# debrief

neotenic leading

learned of past gates

if we want to get back we need to work out the activation runes on the other side

expect to be out a week, 

will be given food/water

objective: retreive drones or info from drones
